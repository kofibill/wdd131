                    <p>
                    My name is William Osiakwan. I come from Accra, Ghana. I have been a member of The church
                    Of Jesus Christ Of Latter day Saints since childbirth. I have 6 brothers and two sisters.
                    While growing up in the church, one of the things i came to fall in love with is 
                    missionary work. I get so much excited when ever i see missionaries so, i developed the strong
                    desire to serve as a full time misionary one day. Truely, i served in the Nigeria Calabar/Uyo mission.
                    I love to go out and teach the gospel oF Jesus Christ to all. Also, my favorite sports are soccer
                    and basketball. I love coding and i would love to be a full stack develooper some day. I love making
                    friends and meeting new people too.
