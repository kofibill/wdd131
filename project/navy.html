    <h1>Brief History of the Navy</h1>
    <p>
      The History of the United States Navy is very rich and storied. The Navy began
      with its inception in 1775, during the Revolutionary War. It began with the
      Continental Navy and was disbanded for a very short time after the Revolution.
      With the creation of the United States Constitution and adopted in 1787, the
      basis legally for a sea borne force of military ships and personnel was
      established. Congress further expanded the power by passing a law called the
      Naval Act of 1794, which created and equipped six Navy frigate vessels. The
      creation of a Navy was an issue of contention with the Continental Congress,
      many of the members were afraid of challenging the British Royal Navy.
      When General Washington seized three vessels flying the British Flag near
      Massachusetts, Congress decided to add a few more vessels to them, and the
      U.S. Navy was born. Congress took this action on October 13th, 1775, and this
      has been adopted as the official Birthday of the Navy. The Continental U.S. Navy
      scorecard is a mixed bag, some victories and some defeats. At one point it had a
      high of 24 ships, and at another point it had only 2 vessels in active service. As
      Congress turned its attention to other matters after the Revolutionary War the
      Navy was disbanded for a short time from 1790 until its reestablishment in 1797
      with the commissioning of three armed Naval Ships, the USS Constellation, the
      USS Constitution, and the USS United States.
      The United States Navy was brought into the new era of modern Naval warfare
      beginning in 1880 until 1907 with the addition of battleships, frigates and a
      number of other surface vessels. President Theodore Roosevelt ordered the US
      Navy on a 14-month world tour to demonstrate the capability of the new US
      Navy. The US Navy did not see very much action in World War I, but came into
      its own during World War II, and in the period since then.
      The Modern US Navy is the most technologically advanced ocean going armed
      force in the world. It leads the world in technology, including the service of sailors
      working to advance the field of nuclear propulsion and nuclear engineering. The
      Navy served valiantly during World War II and was responsible for many victories
      at sea. The Navy fought with valor during Vietnam, was used to blockade Cuba
      during the Cuban Missile Crisis, and has supported our Armed Forces in every
      major Armed Conflict since.

    <h2>Our Core Values</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout its history, the Navy has successfully met all its challenges. 
      America's naval service began during the American Revolution, when on Oct. 13, 1775, the Continental Congress authorized a few small ships. Creating the Continental Navy. 
      Esek Hopkins was appointed commander in chief and 22 officers were commissioned, including John Paul Jones. 
      From those early days of naval service, certain bedrock principles or core values have carried on to today. They consist of three basic principles
    </p>
    <h2>Honor</h2>
    <p>
      "I will bear true faith and allegiance ..." Accordingly, we will: Conduct ourselves in the highest ethical manner 
      in all relationships with peers, superiors and subordinates; Be honest and truthful in our dealings with each other, 
      and with those outside the Navy; Be willing to make honest recommendations and accept those of junior personnel; 
      Encourage new ideas and deliver the bad news, even when it is unpopular; 
      Abide by an uncompromising code of integrity, taking responsibility for our 
      actions and keeping our word; Fulfill or exceed our legal and ethical responsibilities in our public and personal lives twenty-four hours a day. 
      Illegal or improper behavior or even the appearance of such behavior will not be tolerated. We are accountable for our professional and personal behavior. 
      We will be mindful of the privilege to serve our fellow Americans.
    </p>
    <h2>Courage</h2>
    <p>
      "I will support and defend ..." Accordingly, we will have: courage to meet the demands of our profession 
      and the mission when it is hazardous, demanding, or otherwise difficult; Make decisions in the best interest of the navy and the nation, 
      without regard to personal consequences; Meet these challenges while adhering to a higher standard of personal conduct and decency; 
      Be loyal to our nation, ensuring the resources entrusted to us are used in an honest, careful, and efficient way. Courage is the value 
      that gives us the moral and mental strength to do what is right, even in the face of personal or professional adversity.
    </p>
    <h2>Commitment</h2>
    <p>
      "I will obey the orders ..." Accordingly, we will: Demand respect up and down 
      the chain of command; Care for the safety, professional, 
      personal and spiritual well-being of our people; 
      Show respect toward all people without regard to race, religion, or gender; Treat each individual with human dignity; 
      Be committed to positive change and constant improvement; Exhibit the highest degree of moral character, 
      technical excellence, quality and competence in what we have been trained to do. The day-to-day duty of every Navy man and woman is to work together as a team to 
      improve the quality of our work, our people and ourselves.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Core Attributes</h2>
    <p>
      One clear implication of the current environment is the need for the Navy to prepare for decentralized operations, guided by commander’s intent. 
      The ability to achieve this end is reliant on the trust and confidence that is based on a clear understanding, 
      among peers and between commanders and subordinates, of the risk that can be tolerated. This trust and confidence is enhanced by our actions, 
      which must reflect our core values of Honor, Courage, and Commitment. Four core attributes of our professional identity will help to serve as guiding criteria for our decisions and actions. 
      If we abide by these attributes, our values should be clearly evident in our actions.
      Our behaviors as individuals and as an organization align with our values as a profession. 
      We actively strengthen each other’s resolve to act consistently with our values. 
      As individuals, as teams, and as a Navy, our conduct must always be upright and honorable 
      both in public and when nobody’s looking.
      We are a mission-focused force. We achieve and maintain high standards. 
      Our actions support our strategy. We clearly define the problem we’re trying 
      to solve and the proposed outcomes. 
      In execution, we honestly assess our progress and adjust as required – we are our own toughest critic.
      On their own, everybody strives to be the best they can be – we give 100% when on the job. 
      Our leaders take ownership and act to the limit of their authorities. 
      We foster a questioning attitude and look at new ideas with an open mind. 
      Our most junior teammate may have the best idea; we must be open to capturing that idea.
      We can take a hit and keep going, tapping all sources of strength and resilience:
      rigorous training for operations and combat, the fighting spirit of our people, and the 
      steadfast support of our families. 
      We don’t give up the ship.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The United States is a maritime nation, and the U.S. Navy protects America at sea.
      Alongside our allies and partners, we defend freedom, preserve economic prosperity, 
      and keep the seas open and free. Our nation is engaged in long-term competition. 
      To defend American interests around the globe, the U.S. Navy must remain prepared to execute our timeless role, 
      as directed by Congress and the President. 
    </p>
