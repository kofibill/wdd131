    <h2>FROM AIRPOWER TO GLOBAL SUPERPOWER</h2>
    <p>For over a century, our Airmen have helped our nation remain a leading global superpower in air, 
      space and cyberspace.
    </p>

    <h2>1912-1939 CHANGING THE WAY OF WAR</h2>
    <p>
      Fixed-winged aircraft came onto the scene in ground attacks when WWI broke out in Europe on July 28, 1914. 
      This marked one of the greatest evolutions in warfare-tactics technology, soon putting the U.S. in the lead.
    </p>
    <h2>1940-1945 ESTABLISHING THE HIGH GROUND</h2>
    <p>
      With over 30 countries drawn into WWII, the skies marked the ultimate vantage point—starting with Japan 
      bombing Pearl Harbor and ending with the U.S. dropping two atomic bombs nearly four years later. 
    </p>
    <h2>1946-1949 PUSHING THE ENVELOPE</h2>
    <p>The U.S. continued to advance its airpower and military structure, separating 
      the Air Force into its own military branch, 
      and in turn, became a leading superpower. 
      Subsequently, the Air National Guard and Air Force Reserve were established to expand our military presence, 
      with Reservists ready to serve during wartime.
    </p>
    <h2>1950-1953 THE KOREAN WAR</h2>
    <p>
      The U.S. was pushed into the war between North Korea and South Korea. Just as North Korea 
      appeared to be on the brink of victory, 
      the U.S. entered and turned the tables, shifting the war to end in a 
      stalemate and reestablishing itself as a global military power.
    </p>
    <h2>1954-1964 BREAKING NEW GROUND</h2>
    <p>
      Barriers in scientific exploration, airpower and equality were broken within the military. 
      Man looked beyond the atmosphere and began to travel into space. 
      Meanwhile, the Air National Guard accepted its first African American pilot, 1st Lt Thomas E. Williams, 
      and female Capt Norma Parsons.
    </p>
    <h2>1965-1973 THE VIETNAM WAR></h2>
    <p>
      The U.S. traveled back to Southeast Asia to halt the spread of communism. Over the war’s course, air superiority became 
      an ever-growing priority, leading to further needed leaps in development. 
      Additionally, the Air Force fully integrated its Active Duty, Reserve and Air National Guard branches 
      into an operational whole—sharing all resources and equipment and working side by side in battle.
    </p>
    <h2>1974-1989 NEW WAVES OF DEFENSE</h2>
    <p>Following the Vietnam War, the Air Force experienced a relative peace from wartime, which sparked various new technological breakthroughs. 
      Meanwhile, many women and minorities in the Air Force were being recognized for their service, opening new doors of opportunity.
    </p>
    <h2>1990-1999 MAKING OUR MARK</h2>
    <p>
      At the close of the 20th century, the U.S. established itself as the most-advanced air 
      force in the world during the liberation of Kuwait, activating the first GPS system and 
      launching the first unmanned aircraft.
    </p>
    <h2>2000-PRESENT 21ST CENTURY AND BEYOND</h2>
    <p>
      Following the attacks on September 11, 2001, the U.S. was plunged into the War on Terror, with unmanned aircraft serving as a prime mover in air attacks. 
      In 2009, they released the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) Flight Plan, detailing their plans through 2047, which entailed that one third of the planes used were to be unmanned.
    </p>
    <h2>MISSION AND VISION</h2>
    <p>
      The mission of the United States Air Force is to <b>fly, fight, and win...airpower anytime, anywhere.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>To achieve that mission, the Air Force has a vision:</b>
        With a Total Force of more than 689,000 personnel, Airmen work to support all aspects of airpower, which includes five core functions: 
        <b>air superiority; global strike; rapid global mobility; intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance</b>; 
        and command and control. Airpower also requires people and resources dedicated to unit readiness, 
        base infrastructure and talent management.
        "Simply put, we deter and defeat aggression to defend and protect our nation and its interests." 
        - Air Force Chief of Staff Gen. David W. Allvin
